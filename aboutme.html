            <p>Hello, my name is Khan.</p>
            <p>I was born in Temple, Texas and later moved to Philadelphia, where I would spend my elementary schooling years, and then to northern Virginia. I became interested in cybersecurity and computer science early in my life after tinkering with my own devices and creating rudimentary scripts in my free time.</p>
            <p>When most kids are little, they want to be an astronaut, doctor, or firefighter; however, I have always wanted to do something related to cybersecurity. My first experience with “hacking” came from me gaining the trust of admins on a Minecraft server in order to gain access to the plugins and modify them.</p>
            <p>As of right now, I am currently enrolled in Northern Virginia Community college and plan to transfer to George Mason. In the near future, I plan to become a penetration tester.</p>
            <p>Because this is my “about me” and I am not a very stagnant person, this page will likely be changing often. My learning progress, projects, and general happenings will be documented on this website.</p>
            <p>Thank you.</p>
